# Base Image

All ai-dock images are extended from this base image.

This file should form the basis for the README.md for all extended images, with nothing but this introduction removed and additional features documented as required.

## Documentation

All AI-Dock containers share a common base which is designed to make running on cloud services such as [vast.ai](https://link.ai-dock.org/vast.ai) and [runpod.io](https://link.ai-dock.org/runpod.io) as straightforward and user friendly as possible.

Common features and options are documented in the [base wiki](https://github.com/ai-dock/base-image/wiki) but any additional features unique to this image will be detailed below.

## Pre-built Images

Docker images are built automatically through a GitHub Actions workflow and hosted at the GitHub Container Registry.
